            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>3.5 cups vegetable oil (such as CriscoÂ®), divided</li>
            <li>1 cup finely chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>.5 cup minced green onions</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>.5 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>.5 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>.5 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>.5 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>12 (6 inch) corn tortillas</li>
            <li>12 wooden picks</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded lettuce, or to taste</li>
            <li>.25 cup guacamole, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring water to a simmer in a skillet over medium heat; add chicken. Cover skillet and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken from water and cool; shred with a fork.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken, tomatoes, green onions, chicken broth, flour, garlic, cumin, oregano, chili powder, and salt until heated through, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining vegetable oil in a heavy 10-inch skillet over medium heat; carefully dip tortillas in the hot oil to soften, about 1 minute. Remove tortillas with tongs and drain on paper towels, reserving oil. Heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Spoon about 2 tablespoons chicken mixture down the center of each tortilla. Tightly roll each tortilla around the filling and secure with a wooden toothpick.</li>
            <li>Fry rolled-up tortillas, working in batches, in hot oil until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove taquitos with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Serve taquitos on a bed of shredded lettuce with guacamole on the side.</li>
            
        </ol>
